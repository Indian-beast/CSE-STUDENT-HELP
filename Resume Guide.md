### ❌ What to *Avoid* in Your Resume

| ❌ Don’t Include            | ✅ Why It's Bad                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long paragraphs            | Hard to scan — use bullet points                               |
| Photos or fancy design     | Unnecessary and distracts from content                         |
| Irrelevant personal info   | Father's name, religion, DOB — not required                    |
| Skills you don’t know well | HR may test you — leads to embarrassment                       |
| "Fresher" as a title       | Use “Computer Science Student” or “Aspiring Developer” instead |
| Low-value certifications   | Avoid “10-hour Excel course” or “Webinar attendance”           |
| GPA if very low            | You can omit it — focus on projects instead                    |
| Spelling/grammar mistakes  | Looks careless and unprofessional                              |
